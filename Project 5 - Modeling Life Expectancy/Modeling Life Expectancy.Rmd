# 1.	Introduction 

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. Life expectancy at birth measures health status across all age groups. It is often used to gauge the overall health of a population. Shifts in life expectancy are often used to describe trends in mortality. At a macroeconomic level, being able to predict how populations will age has enormous implications for the planning and provision of social services and support. Therefore, analysis of life expectancy is important for policymakers in government institutions. 

# 2.	Research Questions

The purpose of this paper is to analyze life expectancy trends in the United States as well as factors that are likely to influence those trends. This objective will be achieved by researching answers to the following questions:

1.	What is the current trend of life expectancy in the United States?
2.	Is there a difference in the mortality rates between males and females? If so, which of them contributes more to the overall trend of life expectancy?
3.	Do levels of unemployment and Gross Domestic Product influence the trend of life expectancy?
4.	How much influence do social factors such as alcohol consumption have on the life expectancy of the United States population?
5.	Does the infant mortality rate have an influence on the life expectancy of the United States population?
6.	Based on the answers to the questions above, what factors would be good predictors of life expectancy in the United States?

# 3.	Approach

The approach which will be used to answer the research questions includes the following overarching steps:
![Project Plan](D:/Training/dsc520/ProjectPlan.png)

# 4.	Data Sources

The World bank site (https://data.worldbank.org/) will be used as a source of data for this project. The following data will be collected from this website:

•	[Life expectancy at birth, total(years)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?downloadformat=excel)

•	[Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?downloadformat=excel)

•	[Unemployment, total (% of the total labor force) (national estimate)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS?downloadformat=excel)

•	[Total alcohol consumption per capita (liters of pure alcohol, projected estimates)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SH.ALC.PCAP.LI?downloadformat=excel)

•	[GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?downloadformat=excel)

•	[Mortality rate, adult, female (per 1,000 female adults)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.DYN.AMRT.FE?downloadformat=excel)

•	[Mortality rate, adult, male (per 1,000 male adults)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.DYN.AMRT.MA?downloadformat=excel)

# 5.	Required Packages

While not exhaustive, the following packages will be utilized in the project:

•	tidyverse – A collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This collection includes packages that are used for data import, tidying, and visualization.

•	ggplot2 - R's famous package for making beautiful graphics. ggplot2 lets you use the grammar of graphics to build layered, customizable plots.

•	car - car's Anova function is popular for making type II and type III Anova tables.

•	R Markdown - The perfect workflow for reproducible reporting.

•	dplyr - Essential shortcuts for subsetting, summarizing, rearranging, and joining together data sets. dplyr is a go-to package for fast data manipulation.

# 6.	Plots and Table Needs

Plots showing trends and distributions of the variables will be generated using ggplot2.  Additionally, tables showing summary statistics of variables and model testing results will be produced, along with commentary on the results.

# 7. Data Collection 
```{r}
# Importing data from the world bank website.
project_data = WDI(country ='US',indicator = c("SP.DYN.LE00.IN","SH.ALC.PCAP.LI","SP.DYN.AMRT.FE",
                              "SP.DYN.AMRT.MA","SP.DYN.IMRT.IN", "SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS",
                              "NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD"))

```

```{r}
# Renaming Variables.
project_data = rename(project_data, life_expectancy = SP.DYN.LE00.IN,
                                    Alcohol_consumption = SH.ALC.PCAP.LI,
                                    female_mortality_rate=SP.DYN.AMRT.FE,
                                    male_mortality_rate = SP.DYN.AMRT.MA,
                                    Infant_mortality_rate = SP.DYN.IMRT.IN,
                                    unemployment_rate =SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS,
                                    GDP_per_Capita = NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD)

```

```{r}
# Viewing the the first 30 rows of the data.
project_data %>% slice(1:20)
```

The output above shows part of the data which will be used in the subsequent analysis.

```{r}
# Summary statistics of the variables in the data.
summary(project_data)
```

As shown in the results above, the data consist of a lot of missing values in the alcohol consumption variable and GDP per capita variable. 58 observations out 63 are missing in the alcohol consumption variable whereas 31 observations out of 63 are missing the GDP per capita variable. These variables will be dropped from subsequent analysis and missing values in the other variables will be imputed with the variable median since its robust to outliers.

# 8. Data Cleaning

**Dropping Variables with high missing values.**
```{r}
# Selecting only variables with negligible missing value rates i.e all except alcohol consumption and GDP per capita.

project_data = select (project_data,year,
                                    life_expectancy,
                                    female_mortality_rate,
                                    male_mortality_rate, 
                                    Infant_mortality_rate,
                                    unemployment_rate)
names(project_data)
```

As shown above, the alcohol consumption and GDP per capita variable have been successfully dropped.

**Imputing missing values with the variable median.**
```{r}

# Replacing missing values with median in the life expectancy variable.
project_data$life_expectancy[is.na(project_data$life_expectancy)] = median(project_data$life_expectancy,na.rm=TRUE)

# Replacing missing values with median in the female_mortality_rate variable.
project_data$female_mortality_rate[is.na(project_data$female_mortality_rate)] = median(project_data$female_mortality_rate,na.rm=TRUE)

# Replacing missing values with median in the male_mortality_rate variable.
project_data$male_mortality_rate[is.na(project_data$male_mortality_rate)] = median(project_data$male_mortality_rate,na.rm=TRUE)

# Replacing missing values with median in the infant_mortality_rate variable.
project_data$Infant_mortality_rate[is.na(project_data$Infant_mortality_rate)] = median(project_data$Infant_mortality_rate,na.rm=TRUE)

# Replacing missing values with median in the unemployment_rate variable.
project_data$unemployment_rate[is.na(project_data$unemployment_rate)] = median(project_data$unemployment_rate,na.rm=TRUE)

```

**Checking if there are variables which still have missing values after the imputations above.**
```{r}
# Summary statistics on Clean dataset.
summary(project_data)
```

As shown above there are no missing values in any of the variables. Next , relationships between variables and distributions  will be explored.

# 9. Data Exploration.

**Checking Correlations among variables.**
```{r}
# Calculating correlation coefficient.
cor(project_data)
```

The correlation matrix above shows two important points;

1. Life expectancy appears to have a strong negative relationship with all variables except the unemployment rate variable. This is a  sign that the selected variables can be used to predict life expectancy.

2. Female mortality rate is correlated with male mortality rate and infant mortality rate. This could lead to multicollinearity issues in the model.

**Plotting and visualizing data.**

***Histograms***
```{r}
attach(project_data)
hist(life_expectancy)
hist(female_mortality_rate)
hist(male_mortality_rate)
hist(Infant_mortality_rate)
hist(unemployment_rate)
```

There are no notable issues in the distribution of the life expectancy variable. However, all other variables appear to be skewed to the right.

```

The scatter plots above, further confirm the observation noted after analyzing the correlation matrix; Life expectancy appears to have a strong negative relationship with all variables except the unemployment rate variable. This is a sign that the selected variables can be used to predict life expectancy.

**Exploration of additional variables to replace dropped variables**

The alcohol consumption and GDP per capita variables were dropped due to significant missing value rates. In an attempt to replace these variables in the final step of this project, effort was made to explore other variables which could impact life expectancy in the US. The variable  ["current health expenditure per capita"](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PP.CD) was identified from the worldbank website. However, this variable also had a lot of missing values, and hence, was not included in the project data. Therefore, subsequent analysis will be conducted using the original data with no additional variables.


**Testing the significance of the linear relationships between explanatory variables and the response variable in the data**

In the tests for significance of the linear relationship below, life expectancy is the response variable  whereas female_mortality_rate, male_mortality_rate,Infant_mortality_rate and unemployment_rate are explanatory variables.

```{r}
# Correlation test between life expectancy and female_mortality_rate
cor.test(life_expectancy, female_mortality_rate, method = "pearson")
```


```{r}
# Correlation test between life expectancy and male_mortality_rate
cor.test(life_expectancy, male_mortality_rate, method = "pearson")
```

```{r}
# Correlation test between life expectancy and Infant_mortarity_rate
cor.test(life_expectancy, Infant_mortality_rate, method = "pearson")
```


```{r}
# Correlation test between life expectancy and unemployment_rate
cor.test(life_expectancy, unemployment_rate, method = "pearson")
```

The null hypothesis for the correlation significance test is that true correlation is equal to zero. The alternative hypothesis is that true correlation is not equal to zero. Since the P-values for all tests, except for test between life expectancy and unemployment_rate are less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true correlations in these tests are not equal to zero.This means that the identified linear correlations are statistically significant. The unemployment_rate variable will be dropped since its correlation with the response variable is not statistically significant.

**Dropping the variables with which do not have a significant relationship with life expectancy.**
```{r}
# Selecting only variables with significant correlations with life expectancy i.e all except unemployment_rate  .

project_final_data = select (project_data,year,
                                    life_expectancy,
                                    female_mortality_rate,
                                    male_mortality_rate, 
                                    Infant_mortality_rate)
names(project_final_data)
```

The above output shows that the unemployment_rate variable has been successfully dropped. A regression model will now be built to predict life expectancy as a function of the remaining explanatory variables.

# 10. Model Building
```{r}
# Building the Life expectancy model.
life_expectancy_lm <-  lm(life_expectancy ~  female_mortality_rate+male_mortality_rate+Infant_mortality_rate, data=project_final_data)
summary(life_expectancy_lm)
```

At glance this model looks very good because of the following reasons:

1. First, the P-values of the t-tests are lower than 0.05 and this indicates that the estimated coefficients are significant.
2. Second, the adjusted R-squared is 0.9857 and this indicates that about 98.57% of variation in life expectancy is being explained by the variations in the explanatory variables included in the model.
3. Third, the P-value for the F-test is less than 0.05, which indicates that overall, the model is useful in predicting life expectancy.

While it looks good at a glance, it has one significant flaw. The coefficient of the  female_mortality_rate variable is positive which indicates that for every unit increase in female mortality rate, life expectancy will increase. This is counter intuitive and contradicts the observation noted in section 9(data exploration) which shows that the correlation between life expectancy and female mortality rate is negative(-0.9802149). The unintuitive sign of the female mortality rate coefficient could be because it is correlated the male mortality rate. This is a problem called multicollinearity. This problem will tested and corrected after checking all assumptions of linear regression in the model testing section below.

# 11. Model Testing.

To use a linear regression model, the following five assumptions must be met:

(i)   There exists a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
(ii)  The residuals are independent.
(iii) The residuals have constant variance at every level of independent variable.
(iv)  The residuals of the model are normally distributed.
(v)   There is no multicollinearity between independent variables.

**Assessing the assumption of no multicollinearity**

To assess the assumption of no multicollinearity , the variance inflation factors of the coefficients will be calculated using the code below:
```{r}
vif(life_expectancy_lm)
```

If the largest VIF is greater than 10 then there is cause for concern (Bowerman &O'Connell, 1990; Myers, 1990). Since the vif's for all variables are greater than 10, the assumption of multicollinearity is is not satisfied.

**Assessing the assumption of linearity**

We can check the linearity of the data by looking at the Residual vs Fitted plot which is plotted using the code below:
```{r}
plot(life_expectancy_lm,1)
```

Ideally, this plot would not have a pattern where the red line (lowes smoother) is approximately horizontal at zero.In the plot above, there is no clear pattern in residuals across most fitted values but the lowes smoother tails off on the right which suggests that the linearity assumption is not satisfied.

**Assessing the independence assumption**

The easiest way to check the assumption of independence is using the Durbin-Watson test.
```{r}
dwtest(life_expectancy_lm, alternative = "two.sided")
```

For the Durbin-Watson test, DW values less than 1 or greater than 3 should definitely raise alarm bells. The closer to 2 that the value is, the better, and for our case the DW value(0.3294) is way less than 1. As the p value(2.2e-16) obtained from the Durbin-Watson test is significant and the DW value is less than 1, we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the assumption of independence is not satisfied.

**Assessing normality of residuals**

To check the normality assumption, the QQ plot and the histogram of residuals will be plotted.
```{r}
plot(life_expectancy_lm, 2)
hist(life_expectancy_lm$residuals)
```

The majority of the points fall approximately along the reference line, so normality can be assumed. The endpoints are deviating from the straight line, suggesting a heavy-tailed distribution (Distribution is longer and tails are fatter, so there might be outliers).

**Assessing the constant variance assumption**
To assess this assumption, R’s built in function called nvcTest will be used.
```{r}
ncvTest(life_expectancy_lm)
```

The null hypothesis states that there is constant variance. Thus,since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and this indicates that the constant variance assumption is not met. This is further supported by the Scale-Location plot below which shows that the residual points are not all equally spread out around the lowes smoother(red line)
```{r}
plot(life_expectancy_lm,3)
```

Based on the above assumption testing, only the the normality assumption was satisfied. Therefore, this model is biased because all except one assumption have been violated. It can only be used to draw conclusions about the sample which was used to build the model. However, the findings/conclusions made on this sample cannot be generalized to the entire population.

# 12. Project Findings

The purpose of this paper was to analyze life expectancy trends in the United States as well as factors that are likely to influence those trends. The following are the overall findings of this project based on the research questions which were raised in section 2 of this paper: 

1.	What is the current trend of life expectancy in the United States?

Based on the scatter plot(life expectancy vs Year) in section 9, life expectancy in the United States had an upward trend from 1960 to 2019 ranging from 69 to 80 years. However, from 2019 , life expectancy shows a downward trend as it dropped from 80 in 2019 to 76 in 2021.

2.	Is there a difference in the mortality rates between males and females? If so, which of them contributes more to the overall trend of life expectancy?

Yes. Summary statistics of the female and male mortality rates in Section 7 show that the mean and median mortality rates per 1000 adults for males are 177.9 and 172.1 respectively, whereas the mean and median mortality rates for females are 98.28 and 92.27 respectively. Thus, the median and mean mortality rates for males are significantly higher than those of females. While the mortality rates vary by gender both rates have a strong negative relationship with life expectancy in the United states.

3.	Do levels of unemployment and Gross Domestic Product influence the trend of life expectancy?

The relationship between unemployment rates and life expectancy is very weak as evidenced by the low correlation coefficient(0.1602031) between them. Additionally, the GDP per capita variable had a lot of missing values and was dropped from the analysis. Therefore, there is not sufficient information in the dataset to assess the influence of GDP per capita on life expectancy and unemployment rates does not appear to influence the trend of life expectancy.

4.	How much influence do social factors such as alcohol consumption have on the life expectancy of the United States population?

The acohol consumption variable had a lot of missing values and was dropped from the analysis.Therefore, there is not sufficient information in the dataset to assess the influence of alcohol consumption on life expectancy.

5.	Does the infant mortality rate have an influence on the life expectancy of the United States population?

Yes. The correlation coefficient(-0.961422) between these two variables was strong,negative and statistically significant according to testing results in section 9.

6.	Based on the answers to the questions above, what factors would be good predictors of life expectance in the United States?

female_mortality_rate, male_mortality_rate and Infant_mortality_rate. However, female_mortality_rate and male_mortality_rate are correlated and including them both in the model would lead to multicollinearity.

# 13. Limitations

1. There was insufficient information in some of the variables such as alcohol consumption and GDP per capita. Therefore, these variables were dropped. To mitigate this limitation, alternative sources (not worldbank.org) can be used to extract these two variables.

2. Some potential predictor variables(female_mortality_rate and male_mortality_rate) in the dataset are correlated.To mitigate this limitation one of them would need to be dropped or they should be replaced by an overall indicator of adult mortality rates in the United States.

3. Since the dataset collected was annual there were only 63 observations in the dataset. This sample size would not be ideal to partition data into training and testing when building a predictive model.

# 14. Concluding Remarks

An attempt was made to build the model in the final part of the project. As noted in section 11, the developed model had a conceptual flaw in that it failed to satisfy the linear regression assumptions except for one. To improve the developed model, the following are the next steps:

1. Investigate whether to drop female_mortality_rate or male_mortality_rate or replace them with an overall indicator of adult mortality rates in the United States.

2. Explore some transformations which can be applied on the response and/or explanatory variables in order for the model to satisfy regression assumptions.

3. Perform casewise diagnostics on the final model to identify outliers and/or influential observations.
