Overview

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. Life expectancy at birth measures health status across all age groups. It is often used to gauge the overall health of a population. Shifts in life expectancy are often used to describe trends in mortality. At a macroeconomic level, being able to predict how populations will age has enormous implications for the planning and provision of social services and support. Therefore, analysis of life expectancy is important for policymakers in government institutions. The purpose of this project was to develop a model to predict the US life expectance.
